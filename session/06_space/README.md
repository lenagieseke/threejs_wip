## ⭐️ BREAKING NEWS ⭐️ 
For now, the coding tasks will be the same for CC1 and TBAG. Meaning, you only have to work on one practical exercise for both classes. You do not need to separate parts for each class but can submit one coherent project for both classes. If you enjoyed working in teams for the last session, you can also do these tasks in teams. But then, of course, the outcome has to be twice as big.

Please note that there might be additional tasks for each class (e.g. in CC1 submitting your learning) individually.

In this session we are dealing with the topic of _space_ and what types of virtual spaces we are working with. In terms of tech, this session introduces you to the JavaScript library [`Threejs`](https://threejs.org/), which is a good choice if you want to build 3D scenes in a browser.

### Task 06.01 - Your First Scene

*This is the task that will count for both, CC1 and TBAG.*

Build a three dimensional, geometric scene. With geometric we mean that the scene should focus on abstract geometry. You could (but don't have to) find inspiration in the following art work.

For this task there is no need to go beyond the three.js basic elements that we have discussed in class. The scene should be navigable with (e.g., a simple orbit control but feel free to do something different) but other than that the scene should not include any interactions.
  
The result should be polished and will be graded on concept, form / design and implementation quality.

Submit your JavaScript file and add or link result images in your submission file.


## Learnings

Please summarize your personal learnings (text or bullet points - whatever you prefer). What was challenging for you in this session? How did you challenge yourself?
